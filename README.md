# Library Management System

This repository contains an incremental implementation of a Library Management System.
The project was developed as part of university laboratory work.

The application evolves step by step — from a simple in-memory domain model to a full application
with API, persistence, and frontend.

## Project structure

Each development stage is available on a separate branch.
New features are introduced incrementally, and each branch builds on the previous one.
